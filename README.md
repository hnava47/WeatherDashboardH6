## About The Project
This project is meant to display weather details for a selected city. Once a user enters a city, the dashboard is populated to current details including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. The dashboard will also populate the next 5 day forecast.

Once the user starts typing a city name, autocomplete provides a prompt of potential cities. The user can then select the city to be populated within the dashboard.

If the user enters an incorrect city name, the dashboard will display an error notification and require the user to enter the correct name.

Once a city has been searched, it is displayed in the history list (up to 6 cities). If the city is already in the history list, it will reorder to the top. If the user selects one of the listed cities, the dashboard will be populated with the weather detail. The city temperatures for the history list are updated whenever the page is refreshed, a new city is submitted, or one of the history cities are selected.
